Effects created for Reshade: https://reshade.me/
I take a quality over performance approach when creating the effects.

Categorized by suggested load order, but use as you see fit.

01: Prepass effects: DoF, Flares, Bloom, etc

02: Tonemapping techniques

03: Level adjustments: Black/White points, Gamma

04: Color adjustments: B&W, Color Gradients, Selective Color, etc

05: Sharpening

06: Post effects: Grain, Dither, CA, etc

Not all work is mine, much is used (possibly adjusted) from other people. Credits and licensing are individually noted within the files.

Enjoy and make your games look nice(r)!
