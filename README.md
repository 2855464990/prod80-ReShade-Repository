Effects created for Reshade: https://reshade.me/

I take a quality over performance approach when creating the effects.

Categorized by suggested load order, but use as you see fit. Different load orders lead to different effects.

As always, I like to share. If you're happy with my work, all I would ask in return is: spread the word :)

For any questions, you can find me on the Reshade discord: https://discord.gg/nGaJfv

Enjoy, and make your games look nice(r)!
